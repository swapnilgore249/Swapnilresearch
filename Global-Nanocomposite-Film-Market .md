Report Overview:

Nanocomposite film is a blend of a biopolymer and nanofillers to make a solid multiphase material system. So, when producing nanocomposite by the casting method, it is necessary previously to well disperse the NPs in water, because generally it is commercialized in an agglomerate microscopic form . Then, when the polymer and nanofiller in solution are mixed, the polymer chains intercalate and displace the solvent within the interlayer of the nanocomposite. Upon solvent removal, the intercalated/exfoliated structure remains, resulting in polymer nanocomposite films with improved properties . So, the selection of an appropriate solvent is a primary criterion for obtaining the desired level of intercalated/exfoliated of an NP into the polymer. Flaker et al. observed that the quality of dispersion of NP in water has important effect on its particle size and zeta potential, with evident effect on the properties of nanocomposite films.
